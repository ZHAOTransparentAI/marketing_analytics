# Preparations

For this task we interpreted that it is first necessary to fully
reconstruct the dataset and model used in the paper. Even though in the
FAQ we later found out that it was not necessary to rebuild the model
1-to-1 the work was done already. In the following we will describe the
approach we took prior to the knowledge of the FAQ.

1.  We read through the paper and noted important information that we
    would later need for the code reconstruction.
2.  We converted the Stata code that was provided by the authors to R
    code. This took the most time but with the evaluation method below
    we eventually got the right configuration for the dataset and model.
3.  To evaluate whether the dataset and the log-log model was correctly
    reconstructed we used the $\alpha_s$ coefficient and the p-value
    that is provided in table 3 of the paper. Based on that, the
    coefficient value for frequency should be $\alpha_s = -0.001$ and
    the p-value should be $0.006$. In the recreation of the log-log
    model we did in [Task 1: Price and Shopping Frequency] the summary
    output of the model gives us a coefficient for frequency of $-0.009$
    and a p value of $0.006$ which basically equals the values provided
    by the authors (the coefficient need to be rounded up). Furthermore
    the authors provided the $\alpha_s$ values and the p-values for the
    log-log models including the instruments. Applying our reconstructed
    model on the data in [Task 2: Endogeneity] provided us with the same
    values using the instruments which further assured us that we
    reconstructed the model.

## Using control variables

Even though in the FAQ it was said that the model is expected to only
include the frequency: $ln(P) \sim ln(freq)$, because we recreated the
original model which uses control variables, we also included those in
our models:

$ln(P) \sim ln(freq) + ln(N) + ln(Nmod) + ln(Q)$

where $ln(N)$ describes the log number of UPC codes purchased per month
per household, $ln(Nmod)$ describes the log number of product categories
purchased per month per household and $ln(Q)$ describes the log number
of the quantity index.

# Task 1: Price and Shopping Frequency

The authors of the paper want to investigate the relationship between a
price index and shopping intensity. They assume a logarithmic
relationship between the two variables. Using a log-log model, they aim
to capture the diminishing returns of shopping intensity (as more time
spent shopping should lead to smaller and smaller price reductions).

In our approach to this task, we recreated the price index and the
frequency variable from the paper. We then used the same log-log model
as the authors of the paper. This allowed us to confirm that we had
accurately replicated the price index and frequency. We then considered
additional possible relationships between the two variables and
formulated two models to reflect these possibilities. Finally, we
compared each of the models with each other to arrive at our final
result.

## Creating the price index and frequency

For the price index and shopping intensity, we have closely followed the
path mentioned in the paper. Shopping intensity is calculated as the
average number of shopping trips per month per household (named as
shopping frequency). The formula for the price index is given by

$\tilde{p}^j_m \equiv \frac{X^j_m}{Q^j_m}$

where $X^j_m$ is the total expenditure for household $j$ in month $m$
and $Q^j_m$ is the average price a household paid for the same basket of
goods in month $m$. Additionally the price index is normalized to be
centered around 1 by taking the average:

$\tilde{p}^j_m \equiv \frac{\tilde{p}^j_m}{\frac{1}{J}\sum_{j'}\tilde{p}^{j'}_m}$

A normalised price index greater than 1 means that a household paid more
for its basket than it would have paid at the average prices paid by
households in that month for the products in the basket. On the other
hand, a normalised price index less than 1 means that a household paid
less for its basket than it would have paid at the average prices paid
by households in that month for the products in the basket.

## Recreating the log-log model from the paper

After the recreation of the price index and frequency variable, we used
the same log-log model as the authors of the paper to verify that our
recreation of the price index and frequency variable was correct. This
can be seen in the code below.

\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
# This is the code for creating the log linear function
lm.log <- lm(lnP ~ ln_freq + lnN + ln_Nmod + lnQ, 
             data = df_filtered)

alpha_s <- coef(lm.log)["ln_freq"]
p_value <- summary(lm.log)$coefficients["ln_freq", "Pr(>|t|)"]
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(lm.log)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
print("The alpha_s value should be -0.01 with a p-value of 0.006.")
print(paste("The alpha value for our model is ", round(alpha_s,5)))
print(paste("and the p-value is ", round(p_value,5), ". One can see the"))
print("values are almost identical. This results means that a doubling")
print("of shopping frequency lowers prices paid by 1 percent. ")
```

\normalsize

## Further approaches to investigate the relationship between price and shopping frequency

In order to derive possible relationships between the variables, we
first want to have a look at the distribution of the variable shopping
frequency:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.7, out.width='70%'}
ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = freq)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = tertiary, color = dark) +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Frequency") +
    ylab("Count") +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Frequency")
```

We can see that most of the observations are around 4-7, indicating that
most households shop 4-7 times a month. The distribution also looks
normal with a right skew. As the majority of households go less shopping
than the mean and because of the long tail of observations with higher
shopping frequencies, pulling the mean to a higher value, it is
particularly interesting to see whether a high frequency results in a
higher or lower price index.

```{r include=FALSE}
# show median of shopping frequency
median(df_filtered$freq)
mean(df_filtered$freq)
```

**What relationship do we expect?**

Approach 1 (linear model):\
We assume that households with low shopping frequency pay more for the
products in their basket than other households. This is because they
bundle their purchases into fewer trips and do not split their purchases
as much to buy products that are cheaper elsewhere or at another time in
an additional trip. Accordingly, low-frequency households have a higher
normalised price index. We expect this price index to fall at a roughly
constant rate as frequency increases. This is because households that
shop more frequently bundle their purchases less and thus perceive lower
prices in another shop or at another time (spread over the month). Since
in this approach we assume a constant rate of change of the price index
over the purchase reference, we will first use a linear model to examine
the relationship between the two variables.

Aguiar and Hurst used a logarithmic model in their paper. However, the
logarithmisation was probably done because returns are expected to
decrease as purchasing intensity increases, and because the percentage
change is more important than the absolute difference (logarithmisation
can help to represent proportionally equal percentage changes on the
logarithmic scale as constant differences). This results in a
linearisation of the data (as described in the lecture). Considering the
non-logarithmic data and inserting the linear function further motivated
us to analyse approach 1, as the linear function has a negative slope
(see blue line in the graph below). This supports our approach 1. It
would be a simpler and more straightforward approach than
logarithmisation.

Approach 2 (polynomial (quadratic) model):\
Another approach is to assume that the relationship between price index
and shopping frequency is non-linear. Here it is assumed that households
with a lower shopping frequency still have a higher price index. This
does not mean that these households consume less, but rather that their
purchases are spread over fewer trips. Products that are cheaper
elsewhere or at another time are still bought in bundles, without taking
advantage of discounts. However, we also assume that households with a
very high frequency of shopping tend to buy spontaneously or emotionally
in order to satisfy their short-term needs. Accordingly, these
households do not pay as much attention to the price of the products and
therefore have a higher price index. Households that find a good middle
ground in terms of shopping frequency, take advantage of discount
opportunities that require additional trips and do not tend to make
emotional purchases, have lower price indices. This means that
households with an average frequency of purchase represent a kind of
minimum in terms of the price index. Since we expect a non-linear
relationship here, we assume a slightly U-shaped price-frequency
function. Accordingly, our second approach is based on a polynomial
(quadratic) model.

As explained above, we expect the data to follow a slightly U-shaped
price-frequency function, which would correspond to reverse
supersaturation. By inserting the quadratic function into the plot (see
the orange line in the plot below), we can also see this. This
encourages us to continue with this approach.

  annotate("text", x = 35, y = 1.65, label = "Linear", color = octonary) +
  annotate("text", x = 35, y = 1.7, label = "Polynomial", color = tertiary)
})

```

Both of our approaches (linear: constant rate of change; polynomial:
reverse supersaturation) would contradict the assumption of Aguiar and
Hurst that there are diminishing returns as shopping intensity/frequency
increases. By simply looking at the data points, we are of the opinion
that the authors' assumption does not necessarily have to be present in
the underlying data set. Thus, it is even more interesting, if we can
find significant effects with our models.

**Results:**

By running the linear model, we receive the following results:\
\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
lm.lin <- lm(p_index_norm ~ freq+ N + Nmod + Q, 
              data = df_filtered,
              )
summary(lm.lin)
```

\normalsize

The $alpha_s$ value of the linear model is $-0.00017$ (rounded) with an
according $p-value$ of $0.67997$. This means that it cannot be
determined that the coefficient is not equal to 0. In other words, by
using the linear model, we cannot find a significant relationship
between the price index and frequency. This contradicts our hypothesis
from Approach 1 that the price index decreases on a constant rate with
increasing shopping frequency. Interesting is now to analyse whether
evidence can be found that the price index increases again for
comparably higher shopping frequencies.

When running the polynomial model, we receive following results:\
\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
lm.poly <- lm(p_index_norm ~ poly(freq, 2) + N + Nmod + Q, 
              data = df_filtered,
              )
summary(lm.poly)
```

\normalsize

The $alpha_s$ value of the polynomial (quadratic) model is $0.6143$
(rounded) with an according $p-value$ of $3.58e-14$. By using this
model, a highly significant relationship can be found between the price
index and frequency variables. This supports our assumption of the
second approach that households with medium frequency have the lowest
price index and households with comparatively low/high frequency have to
pay more (high price index). Interestingly, however, this contradicts
the observations of Aguiar and Hurst. Using our approach suggests that
the price index for increasing frequencies initially falls and then
rises again. Aguiar and Hurst's approach suggested that the price index
falls by one percent when the frequency doubles.

**Conclusion**

Finally, we can conclude from our analysis that we were unable to find a
significant linear relationship between the variables price index and
shopping frequency. However, we were able to find evidence of a
polynomial relationship, which indicates that the price index initially
decreases for increasing shopping frequency and increases again after a
certain shopping frequency (with a minimum price index). This result is
not consistent with the results of Aguiar and Hurst, who concluded from
their analysis that the price index decreases with increasing purchase
frequency. A possible reason for this could be that the relationship
between the two variables is more complex than represented by the models
and may be influenced by various factors (e.g. the used control
variables). Based on the R-squared of the authors' log-log model and our
polynomial model, we can also see that the models explain only a small
part of the variance in the price index and are therefore not very
powerful. Why this is so should be investigated further.

# Task 2: Endogeneity

## Endogeneity in the shopping frequency-price function

Endogeneity refers to a situation in which one or more explanatory
variables in a statistical model are correlated with the error term
(residuals) of the model.

In their paper, Aguiar and Hurst argue that the shopping frequency-price
function suffers from endogeneity because the shopping productivity or
the shopping skill is omitted in the model. Basically that means that
the influence of shopping frequency on the price paid is biased by the
fact that different people have different shopping skills and for some
it might be easier to find the lowest price for a product and therefore
those people need less shopping trips and still pay lower prices. So in
this case the OLS estimates of the effect of shopping frequency on price
may be wrong, directly speaking biased downwards because the shopping
productivity is not included in the model, but a higher shopping
productivity leads to fewer shopping trips but also lower prices paid.

Another reason for endogeneity in this case could be a measurement error
in the shopping time, as the authors point out. This is because shopping
frequency does not really capture the time spend in the store. For
example, there could be households which shop more frequently but spend
less time on each trip and some households which shop less frequently
but spend more time doing it. When we assume that on average the time
spent shopping is the same for these two groups when calculating the
shopping frequency-price function, including only the shopping frequency
could lead to an endogeneity problem because the actual time spent is
omitted.

To isolate the effect of shopping frequency on price, the authors use 3
different instrumental variables (age, income, family size) which
predict the shopping frequency but are not influenced by the shopping
productivity. Since we only have to choose 2 instruments for our
analysis, we decided to use income and family size because we would
expect age to be influenced by shopping productivity as well, since
older people have more experience in shopping and therefore they are
more "skilled" at it.

## Instrumental variables

### Model without accounting for endogeneity (from Task 1)

First, we compute the results for the model without taking endogeneity
into account, in order to be able to compare the result of this model
with the models using instrumental variables.

\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
# run the basic log linear function
lm.log.freq <- ivreg(lnP ~  ln_freq + lnN + ln_Nmod + lnQ,
              data = df_filtered)
summary(lm.log.freq)
```

\normalsize

## Income

### Arguments for using income as instrumental variable

One of the instruments the authors use is income or wages. They argue
that a higher wage leads to fewer shopping trips, which they have
already stated earlier in the paper. First, we calculated the
correlation between the shopping frequency and the categorical income
variable to test whether income is indeed able to predict the shopping
frequency of the household. The results of the correlation are shown
below:\
\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
#korrelation freq & inc_cat
korrelation <- cor(df_filtered$inc_cat, df_filtered$freq)
korrelation
```

\normalsize

In this case, the correlation is quite small but has a negative sign,
confirming the negative relationship between shopping frequency and
income, so that a household in a higher income category makes fewer
shopping trips than a similar household in a lower income category. A
possible explanation for this effect could be that people with higher
incomes tend to work more and longer to earn that income and therefore
have less time to shop and make fewer trips. So, at first sight, income
is a sufficiently relevant instrument for predicting shopping frequency.

Another requirement for the instrumental variable is that it is
independent of the omitted variable, in this case shopping productivity
or shopping skill. Since income and shopping productivity are unrelated,
we would not expect shopping productivity to influence income, and
therefore income should isolate the exogenous variation in the
indigenous variable (shopping frequency).

### Step 1 - Regress shopping frequency on the instrument

First, we regress the frequency of shopping on the instrument, in this
case the income categories of the households. The results of the
regression are shown below:\
\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
# regress shopping frequency on inc_cat
lm.log.income <- lm(ln_freq ~ inc_cat + lnN + ln_Nmod + lnQ,
              data = df_filtered)
summary(lm.log.income)
```

\normalsize

We can conclude from the p-values that each regressor was significant
and the R-squared value is 54.63%.

### Step 2 - Compute the predicted shopping frequency

With the results of the regression analysis of the first step, we are
able to compute the predicted shopping frequency with the following
formula:
$predictedfrequency = -0.060092 - 0.051878*inccat + 0.493209*lnN - 0.266988*lnNmod + 0.318001*lnQ$\
\small

```{r include=FALSE}
# calculated predicted frequency
df_filtered$frequencyhatincome <- -0.060092 - 0.051878*df_filtered$inc_cat + 0.493209*df_filtered$lnN - 0.266988 * df_filtered$ln_Nmod + 0.318001*df_filtered$lnQ
```

\normalsize

### Step 3 - Replace shopping frequency with the predicted shopping frequency

Now we replace the shopping frequency with the results from step 2 in
the regression. The result of this regression analysis is shown below:\
\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
# run the log linear function with the income categories
lm.log.income <- lm(lnP ~ frequencyhatincome + lnN + ln_Nmod + lnQ,
              data = df_filtered)
summary(lm.log.income)
```

\normalsize

The regression coefficient of shopping frequency using instrumental
variables is -0.07, which is the same result the authors found in their
analysis. This means that doubling the frequency of shopping reduces the
price paid by 7% instead of only 1% when using real shopping frequency.
In other words, the effect of shopping frequency on price increases when
income is used as an instrumental variable for shopping frequency.

With these 3 steps, the standard errors are too small because the
uncertainty in predicting 'predicted shopping frequency' is ignored.
Therefore, we also performed a "two stage least squares" (2SLS)
estimation. The result of this estimation is shown below:\
\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
# ivreg using inc_cat as instrument
lm.log.inc <- ivreg(lnP ~ ln_freq + lnN + ln_Nmod + lnQ | inc_cat + lnN + ln_Nmod + lnQ,
              data = df_filtered)
summary(lm.log.inc)
```

\normalsize

The results for the regression coefficients are the same but we can see
that the standard errors of those estimates increased a bit.

### Hausman Test

To be able to state whether the basic model suffered from endogeneity we
conduct a Hausman test. This is used to investigate whether the
difference of the models arise from endogeneity. Therefore, we used the
following hypotheses: $H_0: \beta_{IV} = \beta_{OLS}$\
This basically means that the regression coefficients of the two models
are the same and there is no endogeneity or it is not solved by the
instrument used. The alternative hypotheses than looks like this:
$H_1: \beta_{IV} \neq \beta_{OLS}$\
This means that the estimates are different from each other and
therefore the basic model suffered from endogeneity (when a suitable
instrumental variable is used).

If $H_0$ is true than the test statistic is distributed according to the
Chi-Squared-distribution with $df=1$.

So now we can compute the test statistic using the estimated regression
coefficients and their standard errors. By inserting them in the formula
we get the following results:\
\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
# test statistic Hausman test
Hausmanincome <- ((-0.071580 - -0.009072 )^2)/(0.024854^2 - 0.003304^2)
print(Hausmanincome)
```

\normalsize

Now we compute the p-value of the test to determine whether we can
reject the $H_0$ hypothesis.\
\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
#p value Hausman test
pvalue_Hausman <- 1-pchisq(Hausmanincome, df = 1)
print(pvalue_Hausman)
```

\normalsize

The p-value of the Hausman test is 1,12% so assuming a significance
level of 5% we can reject the $H_0$ hypothesis and therefore conclude
that the regression estimates are significantly different from each
other. That also means that our basic model probably suffered from
endogeneity (when we assume income as exegenous predictor for shopping
frequency).

### Problems when using income categories as instrumental variable

We have already argued that income is unlikely to be influenced by the
omitted variable "shopping frequency". But using income leads to a
different problem because we would assume that income itself has an
influence on the price paid and therefore is not only a predictor of
frequency but also contains more information. For example, people with
higher incomes are likely to be less price sensitive, so they may not
care if they pay higher prices, or they may just put less effort into
finding the lowest price. So we would expect income itself to be
correlated with the error term in the model.

This means that income is likely to be an endogenous instrumental
variable and therefore the effect of frequency on price is still biased.

Another reason for using income as an instrumental variable is given by
the authors themselves. They argue that people with a higher income are
more likely to own a car and therefore may shop more frequently as it is
easier for them to get to the market. In this case, the omitted variable
could be "shopping technology", which makes it easier for people with
high income to shop more frequently. If this effect is present, it would
also bias the result of the regression analysis.

In conclusion, we believe that income is not a good predictor of
shopping frequency because it contains much more information and is
therefore likely to be an instrumental variable that itself suffers from
endogeneity.

## Family Size

\small

```{r include=FALSE}
#hhsize categories
df_filtered$hhsize_cat <- df_filtered$hhsize
df_filtered$hhsize_cat[df_filtered$hhsize_cat> 6] <- 6
df_filtered
```

\normalsize

### Arguments for using household size as instrumental variable

Another instrument the authors use to predict shopping frequency is
family size. They create a dummy variable "corresponding to households
with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6+ individuals". Their reason for choosing this
instrument is that "a shopper with more children faces a higher
opportunity cost of time". In other words, people with more children
have to spend more time looking after them. For example, they have to do
more laundry, spend more time driving them to leisure activities or
simply helping them with their homework. This reduces the time available
for other activities, including shopping. Controlling for shopping needs
(which are likely to be higher in larger households), the authors find
that "living in a larger household significantly reduces shopping
frequency". So, conditional on shopping needs, which are likely to be
higher for larger households, these households make fewer shopping
trips. By running a more specific analysis the authors state that for
example "households with three individuals shop approximately 14 percent
less than singles and 10 percent less than households with two
individuals". All those arguments would imply a negative relationship
between the household size dummies and the shopping frequency, when also
controlling for the needs and therefore household size could be a
potential instrumental variable for shopping frequency.

The other requirement for the instrumental variable is that it is
independent of the omitted variable, in this case shopping productivity
or shopping skill. Here one could argue both ways. At first sight,
household size does not seem to be affected by shopping productivity
because the decision to have another child is probably not based on
one's own shopping efficiency. However, it could be argued that people
with higher shopping productivity have more free time, which could be
used to raise a child. However, as having and raising a child is a very
time-consuming and complex task, the effect of shopping productivity on
this is likely to be very small, if not zero.

### Regression with household size as instrument

Since we have already carried out the 3 steps required for income as
instrumental variable in detail, we decided to directly run the "two
stage least squares" (2SLS) estimation, as it gives the same results but
with correct standard errors.\
\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
#ivreg für instrument variable hhsize_Cat
suppressWarnings({
  lm.log.hhcomp <- ivreg(lnP ~ ln_freq + lnN + ln_Nmod + lnQ | hhsize_cat + lnN + ln_Nmod + lnQ,
              data = df_filtered,
              robust = TRUE,
              cluster = ~panid)
summary(lm.log.hhcomp)
})

```

\normalsize

Now the regression coefficient for shopping frequency when using
household size as instrumental variable is -0.68 with a standard error
of 0.019.

### Hausman Test

In order to determine whether the basic model suffers from endogeneity,
we again perform a Hausman test with the following hypotheses:

$H_0: \beta_{IV} = \beta_{OLS}$

$H_1: \beta_{IV} \neq \beta_{OLS}$

If $H_0$ is true than the test statistic is distributed according to the
Chi-Squared-distribution with $df=1$.

We can now calculate the test statistic using the estimated regression
coefficients and their standard errors. Substituting them into the
formula we obtain the following results:

\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
# test statistic Hausman test
Hausmanhhsize <- ((-0.068450  - -0.009072 )^2)/(0.019276^2 - 0.003304^2)
print(Hausmanhhsize)
```

\normalsize

Again with this result we compute the p-value of the test to determine
whether we can reject the $H_0$ hypothesis.

\small

```{r echo=FALSE}
#p value Hausman test
pvalue_Hausman2 <- 1-pchisq(Hausmanhhsize, df = 1)
print(pvalue_Hausman2)
```

\normalsize

The p-value of the Hausman test is 0,18%. So, assuming a significance
level of 5%, we can reject the $H_0$ hypothesis and therefore conclude
that the regression estimates are significantly different from each
other. This also means that our basic model probably suffered from
endogeneity (when we assume household size as exegenous predictor for
shopping frequency).

### Problems when using household size categories as instrumental variable

Earlier we said that household size is unlikely to be affected by
shopping productivity. But if we look again at this assumption, we are
not sure that this is really the case. People with more children are
likely to be more efficient in general, as they have more needs to meet
and have adapted their lifestyle to meet them all. This could also lead
to higher shopping productivity. In other words, a larger household size
could lead to higher shopping productivity and therefore lower prices
paid, even though they make fewer shopping trips. If this is true the
results of the regression analysis using instrumental variables would
still be biased downwards and suffer from endogeneity.

Another problem with using household size categories could be that any
household with 6 or more people living in it is put in the same category
for the analysis. However, according to the authors' assumption,
households with 7 or 8 members would actually make fewer shopping trips
than households with 6 members, controlling for household needs. By
grouping them together, we argue that this could lead to an
overestimation of the effect of shopping frequency on price paid.

To conclude, we would again argue that household size is an endogenous
variable because it affects shopping productivity, which in turn affects
the price paid. Therefore, we would not recommend using household size
as an instrument for shopping productivity.

## Alternative instrumental variables or ideas to solve the endogeneity problem

Although both Hausman tests indicate that we have solved the endogeneity
problem by omitting the shopping productivity variable, we argued that
both (income & household size) themselves suffer from endogeneity.
Therefore, we thought about different instrumental variables that could
be used to predict shopping frequency.

One idea was to use the working hours instead of the income as an
instrument, if it was availabe. One reason for this idea would be that
working hours are not always correlated with income, but offer more
information about how much time people have left for shopping and
therefore also about the opportunity cost of time. But then income
should also be used in the model because we still would expect an effect
of income on the price paid (as stated in earlier section, people with a
higher income probably care less about the price paid for some
products).

Another possible instrumental variable, if the data were available, to
predict shopping frequency could be how much time the household members
spend out of the house, for example at school, at work or just for
leisure activities. This is because we would expect that if members
spend more time away from home, their shopping needs will decrease, for
example because the children get a meal at school, so the household
needs less food at home and therefore needs to make fewer shopping trips
to satisfy their needs at home.

## Other endogeneity problems

We would expect another endogeneity problem when calculating the effect
of shopping frequency on price, because the time spent preparing is not
taken into account. This is because we think that if people spend more
time reading store magazines and looking for the best offers and
discounts before they actually go shopping, this would lead to fewer
trips and lower prices. We think this would reduce the number of
shopping trips because people would be able to plan their trips more
carefully and buy products not because of an urgent need but because of
a low price at the moment. For example, a family goes to buy some
groceries, but when they look in the store magazine, they see that there
is a discount on toilet paper. So instead of buying the toilet paper
later, they decide to buy it now at the lower price. This could then
replace the trip to the store later because they have enough of it at
home. In this example, the frequency of shopping and also the prices
paid would go down, which implies another endogeneity problem in the
regression.

Another idea could be to use the preparation time for shopping trips as
a control variable. We would argue that preparation time is likely to be
highly correlated with shopping productivity, because if people prepare
for their trips (for example, by reading the store magazines and
planning their trips according to the discounts of the marketplaces in a
particular time frame), they will be more productive when they actually
go shopping. The authors mentioned that they had this data but only at
an aggregate level and therefore decided to exclude it from their
analysis, but we think that if this data were available at a more
specific level, it might be worth including it in the model and
capturing shopping productivity through it.

# Task 3: Clustered data

The authors of the paper used clustering at the household and product
levels. But clustering can become a problem in regression analysis due
to the violation of the assumption that errors in the regression model
are uncorrelated. Which basically means that the basic assumption, that
the error (the differences between the predicted values and the actual
values) of one observation is not related to the error of another
observation. In this particular clustering example however, if you are
looking at household $H_a$, the errors in predicting the price index on
a particular product level $P_1$ might be related to the errors of
another particular product level $P_2$ because both observations are
from the same household $H_a$. In simple terms this basically means that
errors in the same household might be similar, which can mess up the
accuracy of the regression model's predictions.

Fixed effects regression can help to address this issue. This method is
particularly useful if you're interested in analysing unique
characteristics of each cluster that don't change over time.

To model the data at the household level, we decided to cluster the data
using the panel ID, which remains constant in the dataset. We also
considered the approach of using OLS with a dummy variable, but this is
only suitable for a small number of groups, but if we use the panel ID
for clustering we have $2056$ different groups (because there are $2056$
households in the panel). So we decided to use a fixed effects
regression. We would expect the errors within a household to be more
correlated because the omitted variable in task 2 (shopping
productivity) is likely to be constant for a household over the observed
period. Therefore, we believe that by grouping at the household level we
are able to reduce the omitted variable bias.

To get an idea of how the fixed effects regression affects the results,
we used a sample of households and looked at the price they paid
conditional on the number of shopping trips for each year:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.7, out.width='70%', warning=FALSE}
break_points <- c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20) # defining break points
#labels <- c("Low", "Medium", "High") # labels for the categories
df_filtered$freq_cat <- cut(df_filtered$freq, breaks = break_points, include.lowest = TRUE)
df_filtered$freq_cat <- as.character(ifelse(is.na(df_filtered$freq_cat),">20",as.character(df_filtered$freq_cat)))

ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = panid, y = lnP , color = freq_cat)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "",
       x = "lnP",
       y = "Panel ID",
       color = "Shopping Frequency")+
  xlim(8030000, 8031000)


```

Looking at the graph, the first thing we can conclude is that in this
sample there does not seem to be a relationship between the frequency of
shopping and the price paid. It also appears that for a household the
frequency does not seem to change much between the different time
periods. Because of this, and the argument that the errors within
households are correlated due to the omitted variable (shopping
productivity), we would expect the results of the fixed effects
regression analysis to be less significant, or perhaps there is no
significant effect of shopping frequency on the price paid.

When we run the fixed effects regression model we are obtaining the
following results: \small

```{r echo=FALSE}
# create a panel data frame
panel_data <- pdata.frame(df_filtered, index = c("panid", "year"))
lm.log.plm <- plm(lnP ~ ln_freq + lnN + ln_Nmod + lnQ, data = panel_data, model = "within")
summary(lm.log.plm)
```

\normalsize

Interestingly the sign of the coefficient for the frequency changed and
now has a value of $+0.016$. But by looking at the p-value the frequency
still has a significant influence on the price paid. However in this
model only one of the control variable is still significant, compared to
the initial model where all of them had a significant influence on the
price paid.

Contrary to the authors' log-linear model, here we have a positive
influence of shopping frequency on the price paid. In other words,
households tend to pay a higher price when they shop more frequently.
This is also supported by our analysis of the polynomial model in task
1, where we could see that shopping frequency increased when a certain
threshold of shopping frequency was reached:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.asp=0.7, warning=FALSE, out.width='70%'}
# Scatterplot to show the relationship between p_index_norm and freq
suppressWarnings({
  ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = freq, y = p_index_norm)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), se = FALSE, color = tertiary, linewidth = 1) +  # Polynomial Funktion (quadratisch)
  labs(x = "Shopping Frequency", y = "Normalized Price Index") +
  theme_bw() +
   annotate("text", x = 35, y = 1.7, label = "Polynomial", color = tertiary)
})
```

The result of this analysis and the fixed effect regression model are
contradictory to the analysis of the authors. So we thought about
possible reasons why there could be also a positive relationship between
the shopping frequency and the price paid:

1.  **Convenience Shopping**: More frequent shopping may indicate a
    preference for convenience. These consumers may be more likely to
    shop at convenient stores close to home or on the road, where prices
    may be higher than in large supermarkets or wholesale stores.

2.  **Impulse Buying**: Frequent shopping opportunities may increase the
    odds of impulse purchases, which often occur without price
    consideration and may result in paying a higher price overall.

3.  **Income level**: Families with better economic conditions may shop
    more frequently and may also pay less attention to prices, thus
    paying higher prices when shopping.

### Conclusion

Taking into account all the different analyses, we found evidence of a
negative relationship between shopping frequency and price paid, but
also of a positive relationship. Therefore, we would conclude that the
effect of frequency on price paid depends on other variables. These are
on the one hand the control variables that seem to drive the results of
the regression, but on the other hand also omitted variables such as
shopping productivity that are not part of the data set and the
analyses. Overall, therefore, we cannot identify a clear effect of
shopping frequency on the price paid and the relationship seems to be
more complex. We would therefore suggest including other variables in
further analyses to investigate which factors really influence the price
paid.
